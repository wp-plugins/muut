Welcome to the new Muut plugin! For more information, you can visit our website a http://muut.com. Note that this plugin was previously known as "Moot," but we have since rebranded to Muut.

Following shortcodes override the automatically generated Muut on a post:

- `[no-muut]` disable the automatically installed commenting

The following shortcodes also work, but are deprecated.

- `[moot]` enable flat commenting
- `[moot forum="true"]` enable forums
- `[moot threaded="true"]` enable threaded commenting
- `[no-moot]` disable the automatically installed commenting
- `[moot path="/wordpress"]` enable commenting with on a specified [path](https://muut.com/docs/getting-started.html#paths)

You can also setup Muut with HTML as follows:

`<a href="https://muut.com/i/[forumname]/my-path:with-key" id="moot">My commenting</a>`

Make sure you familiarize yourself with the amazing [Muut paths](https://muut.com/docs/getting-started.html#paths)!

If you have enabled single sign (SSO) on from the settings it takes effect on all the forum and commenting instances.
